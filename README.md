# UI-design-one
First UI Design


We will put every UI Design we do into this particular account

For The first one we are putting them in the UI-Design-One repository .

Since the designs we both will work on will be an already completed design.There is no need for us to merge and all those stuffs.

Instead, just create a new branch when pushing to the repo.And that's it.

You can send a PR to the other after pushing so the other is notified when you push a design.



# The following procedure could come in handy when pushing your design of the particular task

# git init

# git add .

# git commit -m "first commit"

# git remote add origin https://github.com/Flutter-UI-Design-Account/UI-design-one.git

## Don't push to the Master branch but create a new branch with your name and push to that branch

#for Checking available branches

# git branch

##To create or switch to your branch (Name the branch with your Nane)
# git checkout -b your _branch_name

##To push a new branch upstream to Github
