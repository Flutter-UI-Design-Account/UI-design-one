# UI-design-one
First UI Design


We will put every UI Design we do into this particular account

For The first one we are putting them in the UI-Design-One repository .

Since the designs we both will work on will be an already completed design.There is no need for us to merge and all those stuffs.

Instead, just create a new branch when pushing to the repo.And that's it.

You can send a PR to the other after pushing so the other is notified when you push a design.



# The following procedure could come in handy when pushing your design of the particular task

## git init

## git add .

## git commit -m "first commit"

## git remote add origin https://github.com/Flutter-UI-Design-Account/UI-design-one.git

# Don't push to the Master branch but create a new branch with your name and push to that branch

#for Checking available branches

## git branch

##To create or switch to your branch (Name the branch with your Nane)
## git checkout -b your _branch_name

##To push a new branch upstream to Github
## git push -u origin your_branch_name


## The purpose of this project is to better ourselves in UI designs and learn more. So it's a must to check the other's design. You can simply, navigate to the branch of the other's branch and then clone it , and run it on our machines to check the code out.

## We will use the ISSUES feature of the repo to interact about the specific task we are working on.

## SUCH AS 
## 1. Questions about how certain features were implemented.

## 2. Asking for explanation of something in the code that we didn't understand.

## 3. Raising an issue if there is any challenge in running the code on our sides.

## 4. Reporting overflow issues and any other UI-related problems
